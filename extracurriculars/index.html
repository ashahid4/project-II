      <h2>Extracurriculars and Interests</h2>
      <p class="activities"> Some academia-related activities that I have
        been involved in (outside of my field of study) took place at my
        community college. This included participation in the Honors Program,
        where I met with professors to discuss topics outside the scope of the
        class and wrote research papers on issues such as human trafficking
        and mythological female heroes. I also spent months preparing a
        presentation for a panel that explored intersectional feminism and
        female criticisms.

        mysteries, watching psychological thrillers, and traveling.

      <h2>Volunteerism</h2>
      <p class= "activities"> Volunteering is one of many activities that I
        have always found very uplifting. One of my favorite volunteer
        activities has been working at a gift shop in a hospital, where I
        maintained the store and delivered gifts to the sick. Another volunteer
        experience that I loved partaking in was at my local mosque, where I
        helped prepare meals over the weekends for local homeless shelters in
        Chicago.
